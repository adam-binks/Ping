# Ping
My first Unity game, a Pong clone with 3D graphics. May be revisited at a later date.

It features three game modes: 2 player local versus, 1 player against AI, or 1 player "solitaire" - try and keep a rally going.

It is available to play for free [online](http://jellyberg.itch.io/pong) or [on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ping-arcade-classic-revisited/id971852748?ls=1&mt=8).

Issues: touch controls are pretty janky, the AI is too predictable and simplistic, and on mobile performace is sub-par. I'm really pleased with how the web version turned out though.

Cool stuff I used:

<li>The fantastic tweening engine [DOTween](http://dotween.demigiant.com) - a LIFECHANGER for Unity devs. Game feel has never been so easy.</li>
<li>A groovy ambient track by Broke for Free called [Night Owl](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Broke_For_Free/Directionless_EP/Broke_For_Free_-_Directionless_EP_-_01_Night_Owl), which is released under a Creative Commons Attribution License.</li>
